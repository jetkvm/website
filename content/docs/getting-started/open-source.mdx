We are fully committed to making **all software and source code available under the GPL license.** This includes the complete system image, runtime, and cloud components. We understand that the open-source nature of JetKVM is important to our community, and we want to be transparent about how and when the source code will be released.

### Timeline for Open Sourcing

We plan to release the full source code when the **first units of JetKVM are shipped in early December**. Reviewers and early beta testers will have access to the source code prior to this general release to ensure transparency and thorough feedback.

### What Will Be Open Source

The following JetKVM components will be made available under the GPL license:

- **System Image**: The Linux-based operating system running BusyBox in user space.
- **KVM Runtime**: The core application, written in Go, responsible for device functionality.
- **Local UI**: The web dashboard you interact with through the device's local IP address, providing full access to control and manage the device.
- **Cloud API & UI**: The cloud services, including the API and web dashboard, used for remote access and management.

### Community Contributions

Once the code is live on our [GitHub](https://github.com/jetkvm), we welcome contributions, issue reports, and pull requests from the community. We believe that open collaboration can significantly improve JetKVM, and we encourage everyone to get involved.
