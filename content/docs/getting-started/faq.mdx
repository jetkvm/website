### How do I power the device?

Please see the [Power Options page](../peripheral-devices/alternative-power-sources).

### Is there/will there be a PoE version?

The current JetKVM device does not accept Power over Ethernet, though you may be able to use a USB-C PoE splitter cable,
or a PoE extension board.

A PoE-capable version of JetKVM is on the roadmap.

### Does it come with Tailscale?

The device doesn't come with Tailscale pre-installed, though as the device is Linux-based, it should be possible to install.
Brandon, a member of the JetKVM community, has created a helpful [Tailscale installer guide on Medium](https://medium.com/@brandontuttle/installing-tailscale-on-a-jetkvm-3c72355b7eb0). Take a look and get started!

### Can I use the device without the Cloud features?

**Yes,** the device is primarily designed to be accessed locally. **The cloud access feature is entirely opt-in.**

Simply point your browser at the IP address shown on the display to access the KVM. You can bring your own VPN
solution to access it remotely, if you'd rather not use the cloud.

### Can I self-host the Cloud features?

**Absolutely!**

The JetKVM project will be fully open sourced in the coming days, please see [the Open Source](open-source) page for
more information about that specifically.

You'll be able to run the device/user registry service yourself, it's a simple Node.JS Express based service. 
JetKVM uses WebRTC for video streaming and control. TURN is used to make this possible over the internet, 
behind NAT and firewalls.

### Does it work with KVM Switches?

KVM switches haven't been tested yet, but there's no outstanding reason why they won't work. We'll update this page
as the community starts testing it against their switches.

### Does it work with _[device]_?

The JetKVM works independently of the operating system, meaning it doesn't interact directly with the operating system. It works by connecting through HDMI for video and USB for keyboard and mouse input, making it compatible with any system that supports these interfaces.

So yes, it's fully compatible with _[device]_. No additional configuration or drivers are neededâ€”simply plug it in, and you're good to go!

### Does the interface work on mobile?

**Yes!**

The web interface is written in React and works well on mobile devices; you'll be able to use JetKVM's built in
virtual keyboard to control your computer.

### Is the UI available in any languages other than English?

**Not yet.** But don't worry, there isn't much text in the UI itself.

There's an open feature request for UI localisation, and once the code is [made open source](open-source), the community
will be able to contribute translations.

### Can JetKVM control power to the computer?

**JetKVM has a number of ways to control power to the device it's connected to:**

- [Wake-on-LAN](../networking/wake-on-lan): If your computer is on the same subnet, JetKVM can send it a Wake on LAN Magic Packet to
power it up. The computer must support WoL, and it needs to be enabled in the UEFI/BIOS settings.

- [DC Extension Board](../peripheral-devices/extension-port#dc-power-control): The DC extension board can control power-flow to a computer that has a DC
input, as well as extracting power for itself.

- [ATX Extension Board](../peripheral-devices/extension-port#atx-power-control): The ATX extension board can switch on a PC by triggering its power-switch ATX
pins, in the same way the button on the front of your case does!

**More to Come:** The extension port on JetKVM allows the community to create their own novel ways of controlling power
to target devices.
