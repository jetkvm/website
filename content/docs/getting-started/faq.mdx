### How do I power the device?

The **most common way to power the JetKVM is via it's USB-C port**, which will be connected to the computer you're
controlling. Many computers have USB ports that are constantly powered, though you may need to enable it in the BIOS/UEFI
setup. Some devices may have a marking on the constant-power USB port.

However, **we understand that this might not be possible in every situation,** so here are some other options:

- **Included USB-C Power/Data Splitter**: The JetKVM comes with a power/data splitter cable for the USB port, allowing
you to connect one cable to a power source (_e.g., a 5v phone charger_) and the other to the target host for 
keyboard & mouse control.

- **DC Extension**: The DC extension allows the JetKVM to control the power-supply to a computer, but can also power
the JetKVM device itself through the RJ11 cable, connected to the extension port.

- **ATX Board Extension**: You can use a USB-C port, or header, on your ATX motherboard to power the JetKVM via the
ATX extension, JetKVM will receive 5v over the RJ11 cable.

### Is there/will there be a PoE version?

The current JetKVM device does not accept Power over Ethernet, though you may be able to use a USB-C PoE splitter cable,
or a PoE extension board.

A PoE-capable version of JetKVM is on the roadmap.

### Does it come with Tailscale?

The device doesn't come with Tailscale pre-installed, though as the device is Linux-based, it should be possible to
install. 

However, this hasn't yet been tested. We'll update this page once it has.

### Can I use the device without the Cloud features?

**Yes,** the device is primarily designed to be accessed locally. **The cloud access feature is entirely opt-in.**

Simply point your browser at the IP address shown on the display to access the KVM. You can bring your own VPN
solution to access it remotely, if you'd rather not use the cloud.

### Can I self-host the Cloud features?

**Absolutely!**

The JetKVM project will be fully open sourced in the coming days, please see [the Open Source](open-source) page for
more information about that specifically.

You'll be able to run the device/user registry service yourself, it's a simple Node.JS Express based service. 
JetKVM uses WebRTC for video streaming and control. TURN is used to make this possible over the internet, 
behind NAT and firewalls.

### Does it work with KVM Switches?

KVM switches haven't been tested yet, but there's no outstanding reason why they won't work. We'll update this page
as the community starts testing it against their switches.

### Does it work with _[device]_?

**Most likely!**

The JetKVM simply accepts a HDMI input signal for the display, and emulates a keyboard & mouse for controlling
the computer.

There's a great [community on Discord](https://jetkvm.com/discord) that you can join if you have any questions, or
run into issues getting your JetKVM working.

### Does the interface work on mobile?

**Yes!**

The web interface is written in React and works well on mobile devices; you'll be able to use JetKVM's built in
virtual keyboard to control your computer.

### Is the UI available in any languages other than English?

**Not yet.** But don't worry, there isn't much text in the UI itself.

There's an open feature request for UI localisation, and once the code is [made open source](open-source), the community
will be able to contribute translations. 

### Can JetKVM control power to the computer?

**JetKVM has a number of ways to control power to the device it's connected to:**

- [Wake-on-LAN](wake-on-lan): If your computer is on the same subnet, JetKVM can send it a Wake on LAN Magic Packet to
power it up. The computer must support WoL, and it needs to be enabled in the UEFI/BIOS settings.

- [DC Extension Board](../peripheral-devices/extension-port#dc-power-control): The DC extension board can control power-flow to a computer that has a DC
input, as well as extracting power for itself.

- [ATX Extension Board](../peripheral-devices/extension-port#atx-power-control): The ATX extension board can switch on a PC by triggering its power-switch ATX
pins, in the same way the button on the front of your case does!

**More to Come:** The extension port on JetKVM allows the community to create their own novel ways of controlling power
to target devices.
