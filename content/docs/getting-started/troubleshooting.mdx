## Loading Video Stream Issue

The most common issue with JetKVM is getting stuck at "Loading video stream..." when trying to connect to your device. This problem is typically caused by WebRTC connection issues between your browser and the JetKVM device.

### 1. Update JetKVM Firmware

- Navigate to the IP address displayed on your JetKVM device
- Go to Settings → Check for Updates
- If an update is available, apply it and check if the issue is resolved

### 2. Verify WebRTC Functionality

- Temporarily disable all browser extensions that might block or alter WebRTC connections
- If using a VPN or corporate network, try temporarily disconnecting as these can block WebRTC traffic

### 3. Browser-Specific Settings

**For Chromium:**

- Navigate to `chrome://flags/#webrtc-ip-handling-policy` in your address bar
- Look for "WebRTC IP Policy"
- If it's set to "Disable non proxied UDP", change it to "Default"
- Restart your browser for the changes to take effect

**For Microsoft Edge:**

- In your address bar, enter `edge://settings/content/mediaAutoplay`
- Ensure your JetKVM URL is in the Allow list, as Edge may block autoplay by default

**For Vivaldi:**

- Navigate to `vivaldi://flags/#ignore-gpu-blocklist`
- Enable "Override software rendering list" (ignore the GPU blocklist)
- Go to Vivaldi Settings → Webpages and ensure "Use hardware acceleration when available" is enabled
- Make sure "Broadcast IP for best WebRTC Performance" is enabled
- Restart the browser after making these changes

**For Firefox:**

- Navigate to `about:config`
- Search for `media.peerconnection.enabled`
- Set it to `true`
- Also search for `media.webrtc.hw.h264.enabled` and ensure it is set to `true`
- Make sure the OpenH264 plugin is enabled under `about:addons > Plugins`
- Restart the browser after making these changes

### 4. Check Browser Autoplay Settings

- As noted by some users, browsers may block video autoplay by default
- Ensure autoplay settings for video/audio are enabled for the JetKVM site

### 5. Linux users: Try Flatpak Firefox

If you're on Linux (especially Fedora), try installing Firefox via **Flatpak from Flathub** instead of using the system package. This version has better media codec support and resolves video stream issues in many cases.

## ATX Power Control Not Working

If your ATX Power Control Extension isn't responding when you try to power on, reset, or shut down your PC remotely, follow these troubleshooting steps to identify and resolve the issue.

### 1. Check Motherboard `F_PANEL` Connection

**Motherboard `F_PANEL` Connection:**
- Verify the ribbon cables are properly connected to your motherboard's `F_PANEL` header
- Double-check the pin layout matches your motherboard manual - this is the most common source of issues
- Ensure polarity (+/-) is correct for all connections, especially LED pins

### 2. Test Manual Power Button

- Test that your PC can still be powered on manually using the front panel power button
- If the front panel power button doesn't work, there may be an issue with your `F_PANEL` connections

### 3. Verify Front Panel Cable Connections

Ensure your front panel cables are properly connected to the correct pins on the ATX board:
- **Power SW** connects to **BTN PWR + / –**
- **Reset SW** connects to **BTN RST + / –**
- **Power LED** connects to **LED PWR + / –** (polarity matters)
- **HDD LED** connects to **LED HDD + / –** (polarity matters)

### Still Having Issues?

If your ATX power control still isn't working after following these steps, please contact us at contact@jetkvm.com with:
- Your motherboard model and manual reference
- Photos of your wiring setup
- Description of which specific functions aren't working

## Connecting to Device (Safari)

If the JetKVM gets stuck at "Connecting to Device" in Safari 26 (macOS/iOS), this can be caused by a Safari/WebKit regression where Safari may doesn't start the initial WebSocket connection when using a raw LAN IP address. See: https://github.com/jetkvm/kvm/issues/1098#issuecomment-3878012741 for workarounds.
