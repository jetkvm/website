### When does shipping begin?

The first batch will begin shipping will begin in December 2024, continuing into the new year for later pledges.

### Can I still make a pledge?

**Yes!**

You can make a late pledge to the campaign on [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jetkvm/jetkvm?ref=5sxcqi).
Rewards from late pledges will be part of a January 2025 batch of devices.

### Will there be a retail version of JetKVM? How much will it cost?

**Yes**, we're currently in talks with Amazon to sell the JetKVM. 

We plan to **keep the $69 price**, before shipping and taxes. 
The final price will vary based on your location and available shipping options.

### Will you be able to handle the demand?

**Yes!**

Batch production has been happening throughout November 2024, and we have secured the components needed to meet the
projected order volume.

### What happens next?

All backers will soon receive an email from us, asking you to confirm your shipping information, **so don't worry if
you've moved since making your pledge.**

**Keep an eye on your inbox for an email from us to ensure your device is delivered to you in a timely manner.**
