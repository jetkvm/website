## What is the Extension Port?

The **RJ-12 extension port** functions as a serial port, allowing communication with the JetKVM. This port is key to adding extra hardware and functionality to the device, making it a highly versatile component.

These add-ons are available for purchase, but the port isn't limited to just JetKVM's accessories—**it's open for anyone to develop their own custom extensions**.

### ATX Power Control

</Card>

A control board that manages computer power states. It also includes a USB-C port for connecting
a 5V power supply. This can then power the JetKVM through the RJ11 cable. Alternatively, 5V
power can be supplied through a pin header.

The ATX Power Control comes with a PCIe slot cover bracket, allowing for clean cable routing through your PC case - without requiring an actual PCIe slot.

Each pin features dual headers: one set for KVM control and another for the original front panel buttons—meaning you don't have to choose between them. Both can be connected simultaneously.

### DC Power Control

The DC Power Control extension enables power management for connected DC-powered devices, such as mini PCs or NAS units, using a standard 5.5×2.5 mm connector. It supports DC input ranging from **12 to 20 volts**, and we're **including adapters to support 5.5×2.1 mm** connections as well.

Included in the extension package:

- Extension board (pictured) + Case (In Design)
- RJ12 cable to connect the extension board to the JetKVM
- 1x 5.5/2.5 mm male to 5.5/2.5 mm male cable

The extension can **also power the JetKVM itself through the RJ-12 connection**, streamlining setup and reducing the need for additional power sources.

Note: Previously, we wrote that we included a two more adapter in the extension package. This was incorrect. We are including a only 5.5/2.5 mm male to 5.5/2.5 mm cable in the extension package.

### Serial Console

</Card>

Extend your JetKVM capabilities with serial console access. This extension provides RS-232 connectivity, allowing you to access serial consoles directly from your browser through the JetKVM interface.

Connect to devices with either RS-232 serial ports commonly found on network equipment, servers, and embedded systems.

The extension integrates seamlessly with your JetKVM setup, providing reliable serial communication for configuration, troubleshooting, and remote management tasks.

## Customizing with the Extension Port

By using the extension port, developers and hardware enthusiasts can add a variety of features, for example:

- **Temperature Sensors**: Monitor temperature for environmental controls.
- **Mechanical Button Pressers**: Automate physical interactions with connected devices.

If you have specific needs for your workflow or want to create fun projects, the extension port provides the flexibility to build and experiment.

We encourage the community to build custom add-ons for JetKVM.
If you create a hardware extension that works with the RJ-12 extension port, you'll be able to **submit a pull request** to the JetKVM project once the source code becomes available in early December when the first devices ship. We enthusiastically welcome contributions from the community and look forward to collaborating on new features that benefit all JetKVM users.

## Build your own extensions

The extension port is designed to unlock endless opportunities for hardware modifications. Using a standard RJ-12 connector, it provides power, I2C, and GPIO pins that make it easy to develop your own custom extensions.
