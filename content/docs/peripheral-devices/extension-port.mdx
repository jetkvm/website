The **JetKVM** features an **RJ-11 extension port** on the back, designed to provide full customizability and flexibility to your device. Whether you're looking to integrate additional hardware capabilities or contribute custom add-ons, the extension port opens up unlimited possibilities for expansion.

## What is the Extension Port?

The **RJ-11 extension port** functions as a serial port, allowing communication with the JetKVM. This port is key to adding extra hardware and functionality to the device, making it a highly versatile component.

JetKVM already offers optional add-ons that use the extension port, including:

- **ATX Power Control**: Manage the power state of your connected computers.
- **Serial Console**: Direct access to the device's serial console for diagnostics and low-level control.
- **DC Power Control**: Control the power states of connected devices.

These add-ons are available for purchase, but the port isn't limited to just JetKVM’s accessories—**it’s open for anyone to develop their own custom extensions**.

## Customizing with the Extension Port

By using the extension port, developers and hardware enthusiasts can add a variety of features, for example:

- **Temperature Sensors**: Monitor temperature for environmental controls.
- **Mechanical Button Pressers**: Automate physical interactions with connected devices.

If you have specific needs for your workflow or want to create fun projects, the extension port provides the flexibility to build and experiment.

We encourage the community to build custom add-ons for JetKVM.
If you create a hardware extension that works with the RJ-11 extension port, you'll be able to **submit a pull request** to the JetKVM project once the source code becomes available in early December when the first devices ship. We enthusiastically welcome contributions from the community and look forward to collaborating on new features that benefit all JetKVM users.
