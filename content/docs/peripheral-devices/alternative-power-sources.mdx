## Primary Power Method

The **most common way to power the JetKVM is through its USB-C port**, connected directly to the computer you're controlling. Many computers have USB ports with constant power, though in some cases, you may need to enable it in the BIOS or UEFI settings (often labeled as "USB Power During Standby" or "USB Always On"), so be sure to check there if it's not working by default.

## Alternative Power Options

While USB power is convenient, **we understand that this might not be possible for every situation**. Here are several alternative ways to power your JetKVM device:

### USB-C Power/Data Splitter (Included)

The **JetKVM comes with a USB-C Y-cable splitter that separates power and data connections**. This allows you to connect one cable to your remote host for data transmission while powering the device through a separate 5V power supply, such as a phone charger (not included). This solution is perfect when your host computer doesn't provide constant USB power or when you need a more reliable power source.

### DC Extension

For more complex setups, the DC Extension option offers dual functionality. Not only will it control the power supply to another computer, but **it also supplies the JetKVM with 5V through the RJ11 cable**. This integrated approach simplifies cable management and is particularly useful in scenarios where you're already using the DC extension for power control.

### ATX Board Extension

If you're integrating the JetKVM into a desktop computer setup, you can utilize either the USB-C port or internal pin header on the ATX board. This method supplies 5V to the JetKVM device via the RJ11 cable and is ideal for permanent installations inside a computer case. It's a clean solution that eliminates external power adapters.
