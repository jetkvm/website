## EDID

EDID (Extended Display Identification Data) is the information about video modes supported by the video capture device, in this case, JetKVM. This data helps your JetKVM communicate with connected devices to determine the best display settings automatically. **The default EDID configuration is flexible enough for most scenarios**, so typically, you won't need to modify it.

However, in certain cases, like when dealing with unusual UEFI or BIOS configurations, you may need to adjust the EDID settings. To do this, simply access the Settings in the JetKVM WebUI, where you'll find a dedicated section for EDID configuration.

You can either select from a list of predefined EDID presets that we provide or input your own custom EDID.
