**JetKVM provides a video quality toggle with three options: High, Medium, and Low**, allowing you to adjust the video stream's bitrate based on your connection speed and resolution needs. High quality delivers the clearest video for fast connections, medium quality balances performance and visual clarity, and low quality minimizes bandwidth usage for slower networks.

The system automatically calculates the optimal bitrate for each setting, ensuring smooth performance during remote sessions, with a minimum bitrate of 100 kbps to maintain functionality.
