## Wake on LAN

Wake on LAN is a standard feature that allows a computer to be powered on or awakened from sleep mode by receiving a network message, known as a "magic packet." This message is sent from one device to another on the local area network (LAN).

With JetKVM, you can easily send a magic packet to any device on your LAN directly from the web UI. Simply enter the MAC address of the computer you want to wake, and the magic packet will be transmitted to initiate the process.
This feature is **available for both local and remote access**, allowing you to wake any compatible device on your LAN whether youâ€™re using JetKVM locally or remotely.

Please note, the target computer must be configured to listen for incoming magic packets to be awakened.
